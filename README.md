## Description  
The included notebooks contain python functions for extracting, cleaning, and merging of the datasets in the resources folder.  The ETL_clean_kaggle_data.ipynb file extracts, cleans, and merges the datasets.  The ETL_create_database.ipynb file performs the same functions and adds the new tables to an SQL database (postgres).
